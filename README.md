Purpose of this is to mock up what is found in 'mini-project-hubb-json/mini-project-mockup.png' with the instructions provided on 'mini-project-hubb-json/mini-project-atlassian-notes-json-version.txt'.

Outline:
   - I don't have Photoshop and have trouble using Gimp so I used Skitch Screen Capture to crop out the majority of the images were needed. Actually, only 2 images were used.
   - For the tabs, I researched methods on how to do the tabs without Javascript. Found this really interested article on A List Apart on how to do that. http://alistapart.com/article/radio-controlled-web-design Essentially, they use radio buttons alongside labels to do what we would typically do with Javascript.
   - As for the Javascript used, I used vanilla javascript to create the UI needed. I did bring in Mustache.js to help out on the templating side of things.
